## Automated Knee Pain Detection Using X-ray Imaging

This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to automate the detection of knee pain using X-ray imaging. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and neural networks, this system can assist medical professionals in diagnosing knee-related issues more accurately and efficiently.

### Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Techniques to enhance X-ray images and prepare them for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification.
- **Pain Detection**: Automated identification of knee pain indicators from X-ray images.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **User Interface**: A simple interface for uploading X-ray images and viewing diagnostic results.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-knee-pain-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd automated-knee-pain-detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of X-ray images.
2. Run the training script to train the model:
   ```sh
   python train_model.py --dataset path/to/dataset
   ```
3. Use the trained model to make predictions on new X-ray images:
   ```sh
   python predict.py --image path/to/image
   ```
